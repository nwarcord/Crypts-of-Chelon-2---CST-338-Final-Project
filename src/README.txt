Lore for the game --

Chelon was a necromancer that used his followers to gain immortality.
In the events of the first game, the hero Artemis braved the tainted
lands where Chelon buried his devoted.
What she found was that the necromancer's spirit haunting the graves,
still needing more essence to fulfill his dark goal.
Stuck in a state of limbo between life and death, Chelon was weak and
Artemis was able to defeat him by desecrating his remains, severing
the thread holding Chelon to the world of the living.

Now, in the months that have passed, there have been echoes and screams
from deeper into those desecrated lands.
Artemis once again has decided to stand up to whatever force is stirring.
What she found was a tomb, a passage that dives deep underground.
The banshee cries from within form into the grim notes of chants, beating the walls
with insistence and furor.
As the curious Artemis braves the dark corridors, whispers are heard from within
the walls. She is not alone.
